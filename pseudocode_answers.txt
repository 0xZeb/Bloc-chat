### Short Answer
> Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Programmers use pseudocode to develop algorithms and prototype quickly.

> If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Would not likely compile or would throw errors.

### Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

> Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION compareNumbers
    INIT number 1
    INIT number 2

    IF number1 IS GREATER THAN number2
      PRINT number1
    ELSE
      PRINT number2

END FUNCTION

> Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

FUNCTION printToOneHundred

    INIT index to 1

    FOR index LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 100
      PRINT index

END function

> Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION findEntry

  INIT searchKey from USER
  INIT left to 0
  INIT right to phoneBook.length  WHILE L < R

  WHILE left <= right
    INIT mid = (left + right) / 2
           if (A[mid] > searchKey)
               right = mid - 1
           else if (A[mid] < searchKey)
               left = mid + 1
           else
               return mid
       }
   END WHILE
       return not_found // value would be inserted at index "left"

END function

> Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.


function searchPhonebook(searchKey, phonebook){
    var isFound = false;
    var low = 0;
    var high = phonebook.length - 1;

    while( !isFound && low < high){

      //target is compared to searchKey
      let target = Math.ceil( (low + high)/2 );

      if( phonebook[target] > searchKey )
        {
          high = target - 1;
          console.log("target > key");
        }
      else if( phonebook[target] < searchKey )
        {
          low = target + 1
          console.log("target < key");
        }
      else if( phonebook[target] === searchKey)
      {
         console.log(searchKey + " found");
         isFound = true;
      }

    }
}
